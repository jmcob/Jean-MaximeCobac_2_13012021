# Reservia - OpenClassRooms webDev

This is my second project for OpenClassRooms as a student for becoming a web developer.

## Conception

**This page is made of pure HTML5 and CSS3 and nothing more, from a mockup.**

This page makes use of the CSS FlexBox and Grid properties. As a result, the "hébergement" and "activités" sections mainly use Flexbox for their structure. Moreover, the "footer", each hotel card, and mobile menu are made from CSS Grid.

Some CSS properties like color variables, media queries for responsive, font awesome icons and heavy CSS personnalization are part of this work.

Forms, links and buttons are not functional as this is a single page.
